## FAQ

**Q: Can I add backups to Starter myself?**

A: Yes, but Production template saves you time:
- Pre-configured backup service
- Tested retention policies
- Alert integration included
- Documentation for restore

**Q: Is Production overkill for my use case?**

A: Ask yourself:
- Would 4 hours of downtime cost you customers?
- Would data loss set you back weeks?
- Do you need audit trails?

If any answer is "yes," Production is worth $5-10/mo extra.

**Q: Can I upgrade later?**

A: Yes, but it's easier to start with Production if you expect to need it. Migration requires:
- Database export/import
- Service reconfiguration
- Testing period

**Q: What about Railway's HA PostgreSQL?**

A: Production template is designed to work with it. See [UPGRADE.md](./docs/UPGRADE.md) for migration steps when you're ready for even higher availability.
