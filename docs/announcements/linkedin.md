Excited to share: We've open-sourced our LLM infrastructure templates.

If you're building AI applications, you know the infrastructure headache: managing multiple LLM providers, tracking costs, debugging requests, versioning prompts.

We packaged our production setup into one-click Railway templates:

What's included:
- LiteLLM: Unified API gateway for 100+ LLM providers
- Langfuse: Complete observability—tracing, costs, prompt management
- Full data infrastructure: PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis

Two options:
- Starter (~$35/mo): Perfect for development and POCs
- Production (~$45/mo): Adds automated backups and health monitoring

The value for engineering teams:
- Deploy in 5 minutes instead of days
- Built-in security (secret scanning, dependency updates)
- Operations runbook included

We're actively looking for contributors. If you've deployed LLM infrastructure at scale, we'd love your input.
